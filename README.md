# Vehicle-Classification-using-PCA

The purpose is to classify a given silhouette as one of three types of vehicle, using a set of features extracted from the silhouette. Explore dimensionality reduction technique PCA for feature selection

The data contains features extracted from the silhouette of vehicles in different angles. Four "Corgie" model vehicles were used for the experiment: a double decker bus, Cheverolet van, Saab 9000 and an Opel Manta 400 cars. This particular combination of vehicles was chosen with the expectation that the bus, van and either one of the cars would be readily distinguishable, but it would be more difficult to distinguish between the cars.
